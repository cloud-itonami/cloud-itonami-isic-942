  "Rollout phases: which operations auto-commit vs. escalate.

  Phase 0: Read-only (all ops escalate)
  Phase 1: Event scheduling + dues logistics (auto-commit)
  Phase 2: Supply requests (auto-commit)
  Phase 3: Full auto-commit (all approved ops commit automatically)

  Safety concerns always escalate, regardless of phase.")
